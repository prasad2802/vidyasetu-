Fraction addition:
To add a/b + c/d, use a common denominator bd, then compute (ad + bc) / bd.
Example: 1/2 + 1/3 = (3 + 2)/6 = 5/6.

Greenhouse effect:
CO2 and other greenhouse gases trap heat in Earthâ€™s atmosphere, raising global temperatures.

Photosynthesis:
Plants use sunlight to convert CO2 and water into glucose and oxygen.
When was the last time you went on a long trip? Where did you go? How did
you travel? What was the duration of your trip? How much distance did you
cover? Ask the elders who went with you to help you answer these questions.
Human beings have always been
interested in travelling. About a hundred
years ago, there were far fewer vehicles
than today. There were animal-drawn
carts, cars, and trains. Long before this,
thousands of years ago, people travelled
long distances on foot or used animals
to travel from one place to another.
They also built boats and ships to travel
across lakes, rivers, and seas. Boats were
probably the first form of transport invented by humans, much before bullock
carts! Do you know how many vehicles are currently there in your state?
Reading and writing large numbers
How do you write numbers to show several thousand objects?
Let us start with 1,000. What numbers do we get when we keep adding a
thousand?
What number do we get when we add a thousand to 9,000? We get ten
thousand. How do we write this number?
